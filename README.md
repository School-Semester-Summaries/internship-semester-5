INTRODUCTION

WHO AM I?

My name is Kaan Gögcay. I am a 20 year old IT student and have interests in sports,

competition and gaming. This is my 3rd year in Software Development. I have also

followed a specialisation on Artificial Intelligence. I have 2 years of coding experience in

C# and I also have quite some experience in Python and Dreams. Next to that I also have

limited experiences in HTML, CSS, TypeScript and Java. I’m also experienced with

Photoshopping, Video Editing, and Designing. Currently I am also event manager of the

Dutch community of a video game. That means I try to organise fun online and offline

events for the Dutch community of that game.

WHO IS MY STAKEHOLDER?

Tim Waals is my stakeholder. He’s a man with many

interests like making music, in and outside a band,

camera work, psychology, travelling, automotive and

teaching. Currently he is an automotive teacher, but

before teaching automotive he was a mechanic for

many years. He also explained that working as a

mechanic before becoming an automotive teacher,

helped his image and credibility a lot in the school. He

also used to be a cameraman and had a lot of fun

filming but, in the end you also have to edit what you

have filmed and since that felt more like a chore he

stopped working as a cameraman.

WHO IS MY SUPERVISOR?

Erdinç Saçan is my supervisor. Erdinç has interests in

Business and AI. During my internship I could always reach

out to him if I had any problem. Erdinç was also the person

who sent us to webinars and events or made us research

certain AI websites.

PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY

PROBLEM

The Automotive school I am making an application for only has one big practice garage.

Inside this practice garage teachers explain to their students how they can for example

change a tire or change the car battery. The problem is that we have multiple classes

sharing the same garage. therefore they can’t spend too much time per class in the

garage. This means not all students get the chance to experience what it feels like to do

these car related actions in real life.

SOLUTION

My stakeholder Tim, came up with a neat solution to this problem. His solution is to build

a serious game in which students can practise these car related actions. This gives

students prior knowledge about how to work with real cars. If the students visit the

practice garage with prior knowledge, they will repeat processes they have practised on

the computer, which will make it easier to learn. Also more students, maybe even all

students will get the chance to practise in the practice garage, since everyone will be

trained and quicker.

NOTE

I was also asked to make it in a 3D environment so that students really get the feeling

how it will be in real life. Later on we noticed that another intern, Luuk, had the exact

same assignment as me. So we decided that one would create his project as a 2D

implementation and the other as a 3D implementation. Since Luuk has experience

making a 3D-environment and I have experience in making a 2D-environment, it only

would be logical for me to build the 2D implementation of the application.

GOAL

The goal is to prepare the students for the automotive tasks. So that if they end up in the

garage they know what to do and recognize processes. This way both the students and

the teachers use their time in the garage more efficiently.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

I have two main questions. As a result, some of my research questions are related to one

main question, while the remaining research questions are related to the other main

question. You can identify which main question a research question belongs to by

looking at the number before the dot. The number after the dot represents the specific

index of the research question.

1\.1 How do we make the Level Editor as user-friendly as possible for the teachers?

1\.2 How do we make the Play Section as user-friendly as possible for the students?

1\.3 How much should and can we take into account students with disabilities?

2\.1 What is the most suitable programming language and framework to use?

2\.2 Is this even the best solution for the problem?

To answer these questions, I will use

a combination of methods.

This process

works great,

but I haven’t

utilised it too

much.

Stepping Stones Lab - Usability Testing: Testing the

application with a student/teacher.

By having the application tested, I

if there are any issues with the

application.

friendliness.

Field - Participant Observation: When

I have the application tested by a

student/teacher, I will be present to

observe their behaviour. This way, I

can understand the challenges people

encounter when using the

application.

Workshop - Sketching: After testing

and receiving feedback, I can start

shaping ideas. This can be done

through sketching on paper or

digitally on the computer.

6



<a name="br8"></a> 

Showroom - Co-reflection +

Provocative Prototyping: Reflecting

with the stakeholder, we discuss the

ideas that emerged from Usability

Testing. We also review the current

state of the application together to

see if the stakeholder feels that

anything is missing.

Stepping Stones - Prototype: After the

entire process, I have a clear

understanding of what needs to be

worked on. This allows me to create a

new prototype and repeat the whole

process.

<a name="br10"></a> 

APPROACH

For my project me and my stakeholder decided to work in sprints. Every week I had a

talk with my stakeholder. In this talk I would show the current state of the project. My

stakeholder would then give me feedback on what I’d done. In the end this process was

really useful because getting weekly feedback made me make sure I was satisfying the

stakeholder’s needs. You can find more about this weekly process in

“Research/Toegankelijkheidsonderzoek v3.2.pdf” in the section “Deelvraag 1.1: Hoe

maken we de Level Editor zo toegankelijk mogelijk voor docenten?”

<a name="br11"></a> 

PROCESS DESCRIPTION

I worked in 4 phases: analyse, design, realise and advise.

ANALYSE

**Identifying the Problem**

My stakeholder explained his problem to me. While he was talking I made notes to make

sure I didn’t miss anything. I also asked him questions as soon as something wasn’t clear.

**Choosing a solution**

I interviewed my stakeholder about what he wants in his solution and why he wants it.

He told me he wanted a solution that implements XR. I have researched the possible

techniques we can use to realise a solution including XR techniques. More about this in

my Research Document, which is located at the following folder,

“Research/Toegankelijkheidsonderzoek v3.2.pdf” (Subquestion 2.2).

**CMD Method Packs**

I have conducted research using the CMD method packs. CMD method packs are a more

elaborate version of the DOT-framework research method.

10



<a name="br12"></a> 

DESIGN

**Iterative Process**

For the design process I used the following feedback loop. It consists of 6 phases that we

tried to loop weekly.

More about this iterative process in my research document.

“Research/Toegankelijkheidsonderzoek v3.2.pdf” (Subquestion 1.1).

11



<a name="br13"></a> 

REALISE

**Project Board**

During my internship, I worked on the application on a daily basis. To keep track of tasks

and progress, I utilised a project board on GitHub that resembled a Scrum board. This

board allowed me to see what tasks were still pending and which ones I was currently

working on. It provided a sense of progress and helped me understand the amount of

time remaining for completion. Additionally, it enabled me to prioritise tasks and make

decisions about dropping less important ones if needed. Here’s an image of the project

board. This project board also has been added to the same zip as this reading guide.

“Realise/Project Board.png”

Whenever I encountered challenges or got stuck while working on the application, I

could rely on the support of my fellow interns or seek assistance on the corresponding

Discord-channel. This collaborative environment encouraged teamwork and ensured

that I could overcome obstacles effectively.

By consistently dedicating myself to the project, using the project board, and seeking help

when needed, I successfully realised a minimal viable product during my internship.

12



<a name="br14"></a> 

**Coding**

By applying my knowledge of OOP, I developed efficient and well-structured code,

making the project more adaptable and easily expandable. By following SOLID

principles, I designed code that was flexible and could easily be adjusted to meet

changing requirements, allowing the project to grow alongside the company's evolving

needs. Here’s an example of me using Base and Child classes for better maintainable

code:

13



<a name="br15"></a> 

**Problem Solving**

While working on my application, I encountered bugs and issues. To solve them, I sought

help from other interns and used the corresponding Discord-servers. By discussing the

problems with my peers and getting advice from the online community, I was able to

find solutions and fix the bugs in my application. This collaborative approach helped me

overcome challenges and improve my coding skills.

Here's an example of me seeking help on a Discord-server.

About seeking help from other interns, since that happened in real life I can’t share any

example or image.

14



<a name="br16"></a> 

ADVISE

To guide the next intern on my project, I provided clear documentation to help them

grasp the project's structure and coding standards. Within the documentation, I also

documented any identified code smells and bugs, along with recommended solutions.

Also did I include ideas and possible solutions for that. This enabled the intern to

proactively handle potential challenges and resolve them efficiently. You can find the

document at the following location, “Realise/Automotive Level Editor Docs v1.0.pdf”.

ADDITIONAL DUTIES

For the company I had to often visit webinars, events and hackathons and afterwards

document my experience. Also did I have to research certain websites that make use of

AI, such as Flair.AI or photoai.com. Here’s an example straight out of the photoai.com

research. “Extra Werkzaamheden/Photoai.pdf”.

More about these duties inside the folder “Extra Werkzaamheden”

15



<a name="br17"></a> 

CONCLUSIONS / RECOMMENDATIONS

My recommendations are about current bugs, code smells, ideas and opportunities. Here

are a few examples of recommendations to get a brief feeling of what to expect.

LOAD SAVE BUTTON

LoadSaveButton contains hardcoding which can be removed. By removing this

hardcoded piece of code, you will save yourself time in the development process. This

class is made to expect a list of prefabs inside the Unity Editor. The problem is that you

need to add a new prefab to the list every time you create one. To fix this, you can make

the class search for the prefabs by using the function *Resources.Load("prefabs/your*

*prefab")*. I would advise to solve this code smell as quickly as possible, since it’s used in

both the level editor and the plays section. So fixing it will save lots of time in the

development process.

THE INVENTORY IN THE EDITOR

The inventory inside the Level Editor needs all items to be

hardcoded onto it in the Unity editor for it to function. You

can make this a simple dynamic process, which removes the

need to hardcode a new item each time you want to add a

new item. As reference you can look at the classes

*CarTaskButton.cs* and *CarTaskButtonCollection.cs*. In these

classes the same process has been executed but dynamically.

BUILD AS WEBGL ONCE IN A WHILE

The app must be hosted on a website in the end. So, make sure to check if your

application runs the same way on a WEBGL build as it does in the Unity editor.

Otherwise it might give you problems near the end of the project.

16



<a name="br18"></a> 

CODING SUPPORT

Whenever you have a problem you can’t solve by looking it up on the internet, you can

always ask for help inside the following two Discord-servers.

Unity Discord Server: https://discord.gg/unity (Official Unity Discord) Coding Discord

Server: https://discord.gg/code (The Coding Den

LOCAL DATA PROBLEM

The current idea was to open file explorer as soon as you click load level. And the same

for saving a level. So that you can import and export levels into the program. This hasn’t

been realised due to not having enough time. If you do want to add it, discuss this with

the stakeholder first. Look up the following two things -> OpenFileDialog, SaveFileDialog

Right now we use textfiles to save and load data, but this doesn’t work on the WEBGL

build so you will have to find an alternative.

The full details of all my recommendations can be found back in the following document.

“Realise/Automotive Level Editor Docs v1.0.pdf” in the section Recommendations.

17



<a name="br19"></a> 

PERSONAL REFLECTION

In my reflection I will explain how I expected a process to go, what actually happened

and what I learned from it.

PERSONAL GOALS

Before I started this semester I set 3 personal goals for myself.

**Leadership:** *I feel like I can be a good project leader with a select group of members. But*

*I’d like to become a leader that can lead any type of group to success. But I don’t know how*

*I could accomplish this in the internship.*

Expectation

I expected to be put in a project group with other interns and experts together. I

expected the role of scrummaster to rotate around. I wanted to be a better project leader.

A project leader that can lead the group to victory no matter who’s inside the group.

Reality

I’ve been put in a small team, me and my stakeholder. My stakeholder knows everything

about automotive and I know about coding and together with his knowledge and my

skills we shaped a serious game.

What did I learn?

During our collaboration I let my stakeholder come up with ideas and I always told him

to explain his ideas exactly how he wanted them. Later we would look at how we could

realise this into my application. My stakeholder told me that he really liked that he had

the feeling that nothing was impossible. That’s definitely something to consider for the

future.

18



<a name="br20"></a> 

**Time Management:** *I have always hated time management inside software development. I*

*never know how long something will take and I believe that it’s not weird because you also*

*have to take into account research and the time it takes to understand a topic before you*

*can actually work on it. I can work on this by doing point poker and keeping track of how*

*long stuff takes. And in the end I can compare it to see if I was accurate*

Expectation

Be inside a project group where we would play point poker to decide how long certain

tasks will take.

Reality

Since I was the only one who was working on the project I thought it was unnecessary to

play point poker for each task. Usually it’s a good way to make sure the rest of the group

is doing the task they should work on. But if you are on your own. You are the one that

has to do everything anyway. I made use of a Kanban-board. This was very useful

because I could always see how much still had to be done, therefore I also had an

estimate of how much time I needed to finish the project.

I also made a planning from the start of my project. Inside this planning I had to guess

which week I would do what but. It was really hard for me to do that.

What did I learn?

With the Kanban-board I indeed had a very good structure. But something to take into

account according time management is, I started off my application with 0 experience in

the framework I used. That resulted in low level code in my application. Since I thought I

had to finish my application this semester. I didn’t mind the low level code being in the

app and rushed through it so I could finish the application. Later on I found out the

application didn’t have to be finished. So for next time. It’s good to be engaged better into

the company so I’m aware of these types of things. Also when I did find out it might have

been a good idea to prioritise all code to be high level instead of a rushed through

application full of code smells.

But on the other hand, some people in the internship only care about how the

application looks and can’t appreciate a strong backend. This put some pressure on

trying to make the application look nicer, while there were more important things to do.

19



<a name="br21"></a> 

I mentioned how I found it hard to plan through an entire semester from the start.

Something that could help me next time is reading through canvas entirely. This way I

can at least plan in the more important occurrences in my planning, for example

company visits.

**Professional Communication:** I want to become more professional in the way I

communicate digitally. I chose this because the product owner from the previous

semester let me know I could work on that. I can work on this by communicating

professionally to my semester coach and my intern coach. With professional I mean

formal

Expectation

Every now and then have contact via mail with my stakeholders and supervisors

Reality

Mostly mail contact with my company supervisor. Weekly contact with my stakeholder

in person.

What did I learn

Check my mail more often. There were times where I didn’t check my mail for 2 days.

This meant that sometimes my company supervisor felt ignored for 2 days while I just

kept forgetting to check my mail. So check mail more often.

LEARNING OUTCOME 1: PROFESSIONAL DUTIES

*You carry out the **professional duties on a junior bachelor level** resulting in*

***professional products in line with the IT-area** you are working in.*

*Professional duties on a junior bachelor level = All or a subset of the activities Analysis,*

*Design, Realise, Advise, Manage&Control. As a reference use: 1) the HBO-I framework on*

*proficiency level 2, 2) the level as required in OE3 or OE4*

*Professional products = end products and intermediate products as a result of the*

*professional duties*

*In line with the IT-area = You deliver professional products that are characteristic for the*

*IT area of your project. As a reference use: 1) the HBO-I framework on proficiency level 2,*

*2) the professional products required in OE3 or OE4*

**Professional duties on a junior bachelor level**

My analysis on the different types of techniques we can use to solve the solution was

really good in my opinion. I analysed which opportunities there are and put them

against each other in a table with pros and cons.

My analysis on the project itself was also good. I did my very best to exactly understand

the problem of my stakeholder. I had to give a short impromptu presentation about my

project to visitors and this presentation went really well. This was because I took the

visitors through a chronological story of my project. Since my understanding of the

problem was so good. I could improvise a presentation and tell them about every detail

of why I am doing this. So it was really good that I had this kind of knowledge.

I have designed mockups by using stakeholder feedback and discussed them with the

stakeholder to see what he liked and what he didn’t like. This was a good way of creating

an idea of what he wants and likes. If he didn’t like my mockup he also told me what he

didn’t like about it. This way we could work together efficiently and I think we have done

a pretty good job at it. Here’s an example of such Mockup/sketch I made. You can see the

first sketches of the first minigame of our application.

21



<a name="br23"></a> 

*The goal here is to remove the bolts from a tire, and to change the wheel.*

Realisation -wise I’m really proud of some parts. I have used for example base classes

and child classes in a useful way. Also have I turned static processes into dynamic

processes which required me to understand Unity to a certain level.

I wrote a document to give advice to the next person that will take over my project.

Inside this document I didn’t only address problems, bugs and code smells, but also gave

advice on how to fix them. Also problems I ran into and reflected on have been

implemented to the next person in the form of advice. For example how a WEBGL build

doesn’t run the same as in the Unity Editor, so that he has to make sure it works every

now and then so he won’t get surprised in the end. So I feel like my advice part is one of

the stronger sections.

**Professional products**

My end product is an application in which you can create and play levels. The

application has room for improvement, which has been further clarified in my app

documentation. I still have bugs and code smells inside the application that I'm not too

proud of, but at the same time, I couldn't really do anything about it because I thought I

had to deliver a finished application. Whenever I found out that the app didn't have to be

finished, I focused on removing these bugs and code smells.

Furthermore, I think I have done a good job in realising what my stakeholder wanted.

My stakeholder is positive about what I have created.

22



<a name="br24"></a> 

However, my intern supervisor is less positive about my work. That is because he

compares my serious game to other serious games that have been made. The other

serious games are more complex than mine but are developed by game designers, which

puts me in an unfair position. In the end, I am a software developer, not a game

designer. We discussed this with my intern supervisor, and he told me that they will keep

in mind to try to give an intern a project that suits them.

23



<a name="br25"></a> 

LEARNING OUTCOME 2: SITUATION-ORIENTATION

*Situation-Orientation: You **apply** your previously acquired knowledge and skills in an*

***authentic context** to deliver **relevant** results for the project and company.*

*Apply = You work in a methodological and structured way, adapted to the processes and*

*way of working of the company*

*Relevant = Your work is relevant for one or more persons*

*Authentic context = you are embedded in an IT environment and work on a given IT*

*problem with multiple stakeholders*

**APPLY**

During my internship I have applied agile methodologies to my project, utilising weekly

sprints and flexible requirements. This approach was a good way of making sure the

workflow in my project went organised and efficient.

In such a weekly meeting, I showed him the current state of the project. Such as what I

realised recently, requirements I’m working on and what I plan working on next. In this

process I gave the stakeholder the opportunity to add or change or to prioritise certain

requirements. This process is a good way of making sure the stakeholder is satisfied and

to make sure we fulfil his needs.

**RELEVANT**

According to my stakeholder, the finished product would be a useful addition to the

current ways of education on the MBO Automotive. The application is currently still in

development, but I’m sure that the next intern that will work on the project will add up a

good amount of work to the project. Collaboration with my stakeholder played an

important role throughout my internship. With regular communication and feedback

collection, I was able to continuously improve and adapt the product to meet the

stakeholders expectations. Seeing the results and delivering a product that made my

stakeholder satisfied was truly fulfilling.

**AUTHENTIC CONTEXT**

3 days in the week I would be working on-site, and the other 2 days I worked from home.

On-site there were 20 other interns and a supervisor. One day of the week my

stakeholder would also be on-site. Whenever my stakeholder was on-site I took my

chance to ask feedback and show the current state of the project. When on-site I had the

opportunity to ask any question to other interns. Since there were so many interns, there

would always be an intern that could help me with my problem. This made me feel

comfortable, knowing I always had people I could go to if I got stuck. Also have I made

use of coding communities. These communities also added up in making me feel

comfortable, since those communities are full of experienced coders.

One thing my internship did lack is the fact there wasn’t a technical expert that could

give me feedback on my way of coding. During my internship the only one who has

reviewed my code on its quality was my school-supervisor.

LEARNING OUTCOME 3: FUTURE-ORIENTED ORGANISATION

*You explore the **organisational context** of your project, make **business, sustainable***

***and ethical considerations** and **manage all aspects of the execution** of the project.*

*Organisational context = you identify the business domain and stakeholders of the project*

*and know its business legitimisation*

*Business, sustainable and ethical factors = you take into consideration business,*

*sustainable development and ethical aspects in your judgement process using standards or*

*methods/tools (e.g. TICT).*

*Manage execution = you create a project plan and monitor your project including the*

*research activities, time, money, risks and the quality of the solution which is valuable for*

*the organisation.*

**Organisational Context**

I understand why I am making this project and for who. I accomplished this by

interviewing my stakeholder. Interviewing a stakeholder had a very high value in my

project since he was the one that would use it in the end. He knew exactly what the

problem was, because he was experiencing the problem. To reinforce this part, I could’ve

also interviewed the students since they are also stakeholders in my project. As if right

now we do have a company visit planned at their company but after my portfolio

deadline. The reason why this was planned so late is because my MVP was finished very

late. And the reason for that was because I, and other interns, thought for a long time

that we had to make a full application this semester. But in the end we just had to build a

strong foundation. So I wouldn’t blame myself too much for it since I wasn’t the only one

who didn’t know about it.

**Business, sustainable and ethical factors**

While doing research to which technique was the most suitable for my project, costs

were one of the major factors. In my opinion I have done a good job in researching the

possible techniques for the solution, and have put them nicely in a table where you can

exactly see the pros and cons of each solution. Here’s the table which basically

summaries my solution research.

26



<a name="br28"></a> 

**Manage Execution**

I feel like I have done my best at managing the project. An important factor on the

project was that I thought the project had to be finished this semester. When I later

found out it didn’t, I left lots of features and focussed on improving the code quality of

my application. At the start I was just rushing through the application because I thought I

had to be as quick as possible. I also spoke to another student about it and he told me

something very wise: “Even if you had to finish it this semester, it is always important to

build a strong foundation”. And I think he is right. It would’ve been better to deliver an

app with a strong foundation than a hardcoded app. Therefore I tried fixing these code

smells near the end of the project.

LEARNING OUTCOME 4: INVESTIGATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING

*You take a critical look at your project from **different perspectives**, **identify problems**,*

*find an **effective approach** and arrive at **appropriate solutions**.*

*Identify problems = Throughout all phases of the project, initially by identifying the*

*problem/opportunity of the client, defining the main scope of the project and formulating*

*the related research questions, and during the project by identifying newly encountered*

*problems/challenges and formulating more in-depth or detailed research questions.*

*Different perspectives and effective approach = you use a variety of research strategies,*

*methods and activities (reference: https://ictresearchmethods.nl/The\_DOT\_FrameworkLinks*

*to an external site. ) in a structured way in order to find justified answers to your research*

*questions.*

*Appropriate solutions = you use the results from your research to create valuable solutions*

*and validate these with the relevant stakeholders.*

**Identify problems**

One of the problems was that we wanted a user-friendly application. To solve this

problem I did research to figure out how we can realise a user friendly application. I

think the idea of the research was really good, but we couldn’t utilise it as much as we

wanted to. Most of the time I was trying to improve code or build foundations in the

backend which resulted in less time to put in the front end. And less time in the front end

ment less time for me and my stakeholder to add up to the user friendliness research.

This again refers back to the fact that I wasn’t informed about the application not having

to be finished in the end. Otherwise I wouldn’t have chosen this as research since I

would have probably only worked on the backend. Currently there hasn’t been put too

much effort in the front end and quite some effort in the backend. But if I could do it

over I would’ve spend it all on the backend and make front end minimalistic

28



<a name="br30"></a> 

**Different perspectives and effective approach**

I have used all strategies of the DOT researching framework. But I would still like to add

that I am not a fan of being forced to do research which you are forced to utilise in your

project. I believe that if the students are forced to do research about anything that has to

do with IT, It would’ve been a more educational process. I also feel like that if I got the

chance to research something more interesting like Reinforcement Learning for

example, I would’ve had more fun researching it, and I would’ve been able to put a way

stronger research.

The approaches I used for my research can mostly be found back in the CMD method

packs. I can’t really add anything else besides that. I did a good job using all strategies of

the DOT framework.

**Appropriate solutions**

From my research I concluded that the feedback loop would’ve been a good way to bring

the user friendliness of the app to a higher level. My stakeholder agreed to this, also

wanting to work on this weekly feedback process.

I also like how I came up with Unity. It was a well elaborated choice. Unity in the end was

also a really nice framework to work in. It has a big community, lots of documentation

and was easy to understand.

LEARNING OUTCOME 5: PERSONAL LEADERSHIP

*You are **entrepreneurial** around your projects and personal development, you **pay***

***attention to your own learning ability** and keep in mind what kind of IT professional*

*and/or what type of positions you aspire to.*

*Entrepreneurial = you take the lead in your own project, both planning as well as content*

*wise.*

*Pay attention to your own learning ability = you can reflect on your own actions, ask and*

*receive feedback on your actions and look for further opportunities and possibilities that*

*flow from that feedback and that you are aware of your development as an IT professional*

**Entrepreneurial**

I was the only one actually working on the project, meaning I could approach it anyway I

wanted to. I started off by making a rough planning wherein you can see which week I

would be doing what. Here’s an image of the planning

30



<a name="br32"></a> 

I tried to make this planning based on the information on canvas. Canvas contained all

deadlines in my semester, so I tried to use those dates as a base for the planning. As time

passed I created a project board to help me with the planning. This project board was a

very good addition because it was more clear then the planning I made at the start of the

semester. The project board contained all features I made, was working on and still had

to do. The project board showed all features in a list, this gave me a relaxing feeling since

I knew exactly how much still had to be done at any time. Here’s an image of the board

currently.

For more details about the project board you can take a look at an older version of my

project board. (Realise/Project Board.png)

31



<a name="br33"></a> 

**Pay attention to your own learning ability**

I have had weekly feedback from both my stakeholder and my school supervisor. This

was very useful since I was always aware if my project was going in the good direction

and if my project was satisfying my stakeholders needs. Here are my notes on the latest

feedback the school supervisor gave me.

This document that I’m writing is also a good addition to this learning outcome. In this

document I show that I’m able to reflect on my previously done actions and that I can

learn from them. One downside of the document that I am currently writing is that I

made it in google documents. Google documents does not satisfy my needs that I look for

when writing a document. Word on the other hand does. So for the next time starting in

word would save me a headache.

LEARNING OUTCOME 6: TARGETED INTERACTION

*You determine which **partners** play a role in your project, collaborate constructively with*

*them and **communicate appropriately** to achieve the desired impact.*

*Communicate appropriately = you make sure that your communication has the right*

*impact and execution.*

*Partners = the different stakeholders in the project to which you pay attention to and whose*

*interest in the project are clear to you.*

**Communicate appropriately**

Communication-wise I think I have done a pretty good job. In this semester there were 3

main people I have had contact with.

\-

My stakeholder: Me and my stakeholder would have weekly contact every

tuesday. If one of us was sick or wasn’t able to show up for any other reason, we

would update the other about it. Also When one of us was sick, I still tried to show

a new functionality I made. I did that because I wanted to make sure the

stakeholder knew I was continuously working on the project. Here’s an example

of me updating my stakeholder on the project status. In my opinion the contact

between me and my stakeholder was very good. Also the bond between me and

my stakeholder was really good. I had a very open minded stakeholder, who I

could talk with for hours, even about topics outside the internship.

33



<a name="br35"></a> 

\-

My intern supervisor: The communication between me and my supervisor was a

mix between online and real life contact.In real life my supervisor would ask me

if I had any problems or just came to talk with me about actual topics. Online my

supervisor would ask me to research certain websites for him, or to visit webinars

and events. Online contact was mainly executed via mail, but sometimes also via

Whatsapp. The only downside to the contact between me and my supervisor is

when I missed an email from my stakeholder. But he would point it out to me as

soon as he noticed. I’m glad he pointed it out, from that point I started to pay more

attention to it.

34



<a name="br36"></a> 

\-

My school supervisor. I have had weekly contact with my school supervisor. In

this appointment we would discuss any work I was working on, review code and

ask questions about actual topics. My supervisor gave me weekly feedback on

anything I needed feedback on, which I really liked. Since we spoke to each other

weekly we could identify problems quickly.
